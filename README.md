bsdiff-thh
==========

bsdiff-thh is a branch of bsdiff, a utility for diffing and patching binary files.

This distribution provides the two utilities bsdiff and bspatch. Unsurprisingly, the first
creates a patch from two source files, the second applies the patch to the first file to
obtain the second. For convenience, the order of arguments is the same for both"
